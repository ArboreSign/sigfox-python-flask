## SIGFOX Python Flask Callback Tutorial

This tutorial briefly explains how to use SIGFOX's callback method to POST data to a Python Flask server. This example utilises a mock/placeholder 'Temperature' sensor that is represented by an Akeru Board (by Snootlabs) but could easily be replaced with a SIGFOX enabled device of your choosing.
